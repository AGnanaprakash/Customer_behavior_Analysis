# Customer_behavior_Analysis
# Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from data ingestion and exploration to visualization and reporting. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data using Python, SQL, and BI tools, and present the results through an interactive dashboard and a professional presentation.

# Dataset

The dataset is loaded and processed using Python.

It contains structured data suitable for exploratory analysis and SQL querying.

Data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats were identified and handled during the cleaning phase.

Note: Dataset details (source, size, or domain) can be added here if publicly shareable.

# Tools & Technologies

Python: Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

PostgreSQL: Data storage and SQL querying

SQL: Data aggregation, filtering, and analysis

Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma: Report and presentation (PPT) creation

# Project Steps

# Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python for analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data distributions, trends, and relationships.

Identified missing values and outliers.

# Data Cleaning

Handled missing and inconsistent data.

Removed duplicates and standardized formats.

# Database Integration

Loaded the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL.

# SQL Analysis

Wrote SQL queries to generate insights and summary metrics.

# Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key findings.

# Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured report and presentation using Gamma.

# Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Key performance metrics and summary statistics

Trend analysis and comparisons

Interactive filters for deeper exploration

# Results & Insights

Identified key patterns and trends in the data.

Provided data-driven insights to support decision-making.

Delivered results through clear visualizations and summaries.
